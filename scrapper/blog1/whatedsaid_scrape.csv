3,b'Circle of viewpoints\xe2\x80\xa6',"b' A colleague of mine has three daughters. One says when school shuts, she will follow her daily schedule and stick to the school routines. Another says she will finally have time to work on her personal projects. The third says that she will see how she feels when she wakes up each day. As we prepare for school closure in Australia, emotions are heightened and interactions are fraught as individuals struggle with their particular anxieties and uncertainties. It\xe2\x80\x99s a time for empathy, for pausing to remember that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s reality is different and, for many, stories they don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to share might be impacting their very way of being. What seemed right when we started preparing our guidelines for remote learning (was it really only the week before last?) has already been adapted several times and is still changing, as the sands rapidly shift. If ever there was an appropriate, authentic time to practise the Circle of Viewpoints thinking routine for exploring different perspectives, from Project Zero, this is it. What might different teachers need right now? How might parents be feeling? How will we meet the needs of our diverse learners, as students and as human beings? What will our students need? What will our parents need? What will educators need? As we plan for school closure, the most important thing to remember is that one size will not fit all. Awareness of the myriad factors, other than school, currently impacting lives, is paramount. \xc2\xa0'",https://whatedsaid.wordpress.com/2020/03/22/circle-of-viewpoints/,1,0,1584911760.0,b'aggiekesler',b'',"b'So many great questions to consider.

4,b'An inquiry into remote\xc2\xa0learning\xe2\x80\xa6',"b' In Australia we have now begun planning for continuous remote learning, given the inevitability of school closure to limit the spread of COVID-19. I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of my very first blog post, more than ten years ago! It is important to start by recognising how incredibly fortunate we are. How many children around the world experience interruption to schooling due to disease, natural disaster or war? How many have access to an education at all? Of those that do, how many are lucky enough to have ready access to the resources that we do? Do we understand that in remote communities, this might be the way learning always looks? Do we appreciate the technology, books, materials, time, space and people to whom/which we have access? Do we acknowledge the collective wisdom and generosity of other teachers and schools with more experience than we have, readily sharing their ideas and expertise with us? We have so much to be grateful for. The initial response of our teachers, ranging from excitement to panic, depends on individual perspective, personal circumstance, prior experience, technological ability and comfort level with the unknown. So our stance, at my school, will be to see this as an opportunity rather than a challenge. We will approach it, as always, as an inquiry, an extension of our 2020 focus on building cohesion. We will expand our whole school inquiry into building community and a sense of belonging into the new and unfamiliar territory in which we find ourselves. So these are some of our initial inquiry questions:  \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'",https://whatedsaid.wordpress.com/2020/03/14/an-inquiry-into-remote-learning/,,,,,,

It is the glue that binds us to every element of our social context.\xc2\xa0When there is strong healthy cohesion in school communities, we feel connected to those around us; we\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page with them.\xc2\xa0We feel we belong, that we are part of the team, with shared values and a shared sense of what is normal.\xe2\x80\x9d Helen Street: CONTEXTUAL WELLBEING (Slightly adapted) How might we build cohesion? With \xe2\x80\x98building cohesion\xe2\x80\x99 as our 2020 focus, we started the year with a whole school workshop in which over 120 educators across disciplines and campuses connected and interconnected through a range of activities. Noticing and naming the ways they built cohesion, each time they changed groups during the morning, heightened awareness and highlighted transferable possibilities. In groups, teachers shared a highlight from the holidays and something they hope for this year. Next we asked each person to consider and share a time when they felt a sense of belonging and identify common characteristics. Co-developing this shared understanding of how it feels to belong will help us reflect on the extent to which these things are evident in our classrooms and in our learning community, and to recognise possibilities for improvement.    How might we build cohesion in our classrooms? Many of us have already read and engaged with the content of the book \xe2\x80\x98Contextual Wellbeing\xe2\x80\x99 as a springboard for such reflections. Providing quotes such as those below helped provoke thinking and encourage a flow of ideas. With any wellbeing program\xe2\x80\xa6 teachers have to be careful not to counteract their positive impact with unnecessary class competition and inequitable teaching the rest of the time. As soon as students are pitted against each other with tests, awards or ability grouping, cohesion and positive relationships suffer. It is the power of \xe2\x80\x98show over tell\xe2\x80\x99: explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies has to be backed up with real life contextual wellbeing. Teachers are under continual pressure to make headway with a dauntingly large curriculum, so it is a big ask that they regularly find time for gluing the class together. But that time willingly spent on building cohesion will save an enormous amount of wasted time and energy throughout the rest of the year. A happy class is a cohesive class is a productive class. Norms and rules are not the same thing. It does not matter what rules apply to the classroom, it is the established norms that guide the behaviour of those who feel they belong. Rules are written down and made explicit whereas norms are established through the repetition of certain behaviours and reinforced with every element of social context. Norms are the true behavioural guides within any group. Norms develop through repeating desired behaviours, and contextual support, not through repeated verbal reminders. The more a class follows the rules in their daily activities, the more likely the rules will become norms. It also follows that the more the rules are broken, the more \xe2\x80\x98not following the rules\xe2\x80\x99 will become the normal way to behave. Rewards and punishments may bring a disruptive child to the river of compliance, but only cohesion will keep them drinking. Instead of \xe2\x80\x98paying\xe2\x80\x99 disconnected kids to behave, or threatening them if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we need to help them connect to a world where positive behaviour is normal.   How might we further extend the idea of building cohesion? Teachers then engaged with a series of broader questions which emerged from our self study, addressing how we might build cohesion beyond our classrooms, in our curriculum, in our community and in our culture. Building cohesion in all these areas will be the theme and the through-line of our action plan as we move forward.

Every grade level wrote different lines of inquiry so explored it from different angles\xe2\x80\x93that worked well but it lost its impact by the 2nd year, and it was hard to figure out how to \xe2\x80\x9cfit it in\xe2\x80\x9d with reporting.

With that experience in mind, I feel that when you are more beholden to national standards, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to \xe2\x80\x9clet go\xe2\x80\x9d of a TD theme because you have to think about how to cover content standards.
