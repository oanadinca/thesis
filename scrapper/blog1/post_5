Every grade level wrote different lines of inquiry so explored it from different angles\xe2\x80\x93that worked well but it lost its impact by the 2nd year, and it was hard to figure out how to \xe2\x80\x9cfit it in\xe2\x80\x9d with reporting. Some glitches\xe2\x80\xa6for sure. With that experience in mind, I feel that when you are more beholden to national standards, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to \xe2\x80\x9clet go\xe2\x80\x9d of a TD theme because you have to think about how to cover content standards. So I think having a Whole School UOI that sits outside of the POI will allow for more flexibility overall. If we decide to change the UOI the following year, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to affect vertical or horizontal articulation with the standards. Also, in Brazil, where I live, we have a lot of community events on Saturdays, so I think having a UOI that stands outside of standards provides an anchor in what and how we plan those school events. Of course, that is my thinking at the moment\xe2\x80\xa6.always subject to change as I reflect and discuss with teachers, students, and parents.'"
5,b'Building cohesion\xe2\x80\xa6',"b' \xe2\x80\x9cCohesion is the powerful social glue that turns us from human beings into people. It is the glue that binds us to every element of our social context.\xc2\xa0When there is strong healthy cohesion in school communities, we feel connected to those around us; we\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page with them.\xc2\xa0We feel we belong, that we are part of the team, with shared values and a shared sense of what is normal.\xe2\x80\x9d Helen Street: CONTEXTUAL WELLBEING (Slightly adapted) How might we build cohesion? With \xe2\x80\x98building cohesion\xe2\x80\x99 as our 2020 focus, we started the year with a whole school workshop in which over 120 educators across disciplines and campuses connected and interconnected through a range of activities. Noticing and naming the ways they built cohesion, each time they changed groups during the morning, heightened awareness and highlighted transferable possibilities. In groups, teachers shared a highlight from the holidays and something they hope for this year. Next we asked each person to consider and share a time when they felt a sense of belonging and identify common characteristics. Co-developing this shared understanding of how it feels to belong will help us reflect on the extent to which these things are evident in our classrooms and in our learning community, and to recognise possibilities for improvement.    How might we build cohesion in our classrooms? Many of us have already read and engaged with the content of the book \xe2\x80\x98Contextual Wellbeing\xe2\x80\x99 as a springboard for such reflections. Providing quotes such as those below helped provoke thinking and encourage a flow of ideas. With any wellbeing program\xe2\x80\xa6 teachers have to be careful not to counteract their positive impact with unnecessary class competition and inequitable teaching the rest of the time. As soon as students are pitted against each other with tests, awards or ability grouping, cohesion and positive relationships suffer.
