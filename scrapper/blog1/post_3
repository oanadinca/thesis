3,b'Circle of viewpoints\xe2\x80\xa6',"b' A colleague of mine has three daughters. One says when school shuts, she will follow her daily schedule and stick to the school routines. Another says she will finally have time to work on her personal projects. The third says that she will see how she feels when she wakes up each day. As we prepare for school closure in Australia, emotions are heightened and interactions are fraught as individuals struggle with their particular anxieties and uncertainties. It\xe2\x80\x99s a time for empathy, for pausing to remember that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s reality is different and, for many, stories they don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to share might be impacting their very way of being. What seemed right when we started preparing our guidelines for remote learning (was it really only the week before last?) has already been adapted several times and is still changing, as the sands rapidly shift. If ever there was an appropriate, authentic time to practise the Circle of Viewpoints thinking routine for exploring different perspectives, from Project Zero, this is it. What might different teachers need right now? How might parents be feeling? How will we meet the needs of our diverse learners, as students and as human beings? What will our students need? What will our parents need? What will educators need? As we plan for school closure, the most important thing to remember is that one size will not fit all. Awareness of the myriad factors, other than school, currently impacting lives, is paramount. \xc2\xa0'",https://whatedsaid.wordpress.com/2020/03/22/circle-of-viewpoints/,1,0,1584911760.0,b'aggiekesler',b'',"b'So many great questions to consider.
