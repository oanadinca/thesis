5,b'I Love Attawapiskat & Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Aboriginal\xc2\xa0Youth',"b' I am from Ontario, Canada. The place where I was born is called Mississauga and it is on the shores of Lake Ontario. \xc2\xa0There is another place in northern Ontario that I have never been to, but hope to visit some day: it is a nation\xc2\xa0in the Kenora District called\xc2\xa0Attawapiskat First Nation\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 it is one of 49 nations comprising the Nishnawbe Aski Nation.\xc2\xa0It came to national news a few months ago, because of the very high rate of suicides that had occurred and unfortunately keep happening, even at very young ages. I started following the news about Attawapiskat any way I could, and saw that the people there have severe lack in housing, medicare, everyday needs. They did not stop, they have not given up. They have a wonderful Grand Chief, Alvin Fiddler, and their\xc2\xa0chief is\xc2\xa0Chief Bruce Shisheesh. Chief Shisheesh met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau two days ago to discuss the actions to be taken for the community.\xc2\xa0 There is a website called I love Attawapiskat & Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Aboriginal Youth, which shows their various activities and the things they do not only to help their own community, but other communities reeling from suicide and hardship across the whole country! Iain G. Speirs and Josee\xc2\xa0Lusignan are in charge of the Twitter account and much more for I Love Attawapiskat\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 they are the founders of this organisation\xc2\xa0and Josee is also the founder of I Love First Peoples; they work tirelessly, night and day! I am in awe of all that they do. On their website you can see different ways to help. With this post, I hope to help raise awareness about Attawapiskat as much as possible. As an educator, aunt, godmother, Canadian and human, I hope to raise awareness for these amazing people, these brilliant children and their lives. Attawapiskat, I have not met you yet, but I know you are amazing and I send all my love and warmest wishes. Will you say I LOVE ATTAWAPISKAT with lots of other people who support the cause? Watch this video with Chief Shisheesh: \xc2\xa0 And here are some of the amazing young people of Attawapiskat, singing and walking for peace!\xc2\xa0 Note: Thank you so much to Josee and Iain for helping me learn so much and adding lots of details to this post.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'",https://vickyloras.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/i-love-attawapiskat-canadas-aboriginal-youth/,,,,,,
6,b'The day k d lang came to our class\xe2\x80\xa6with Godot (Pt\xc2\xa02)',"b' \xc2\xa0 Last December, I published Part 1 of a lesson plan based on k d lang\xe2\x80\x98s song Constant Craving, in\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0combination with the amazing theatrical play by Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot. Many are the times when with students we study literature or work on songs in English. Little did we know, that with working on the lyrics from Constant Craving we would be led to look at parts of a theatrical play \xe2\x80\x93 and some of the students would read the whole thing! In my language classes, due to time restrictions or goals such as examinations or getting to a specific level by a specific time, unfortunately we do not have the luxury of looking at the whole play, which in my opinion is amazing and I cannot do it justice, I feel. However, the parts that we do work on are interesting for the students and lead them to converse and also write in English \xe2\x80\x93 that is one of the things we want them to do. So here we go!  Things we usually do with the students before we start working on the text:\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 When we start working on the text:\xc2\xa0 Here comes one of my favourite excerpts from the play, with two of the main characters, Vladimir and Estragon: ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Charming spot. (He turns, advances to front, halts facing auditorium.) Inspiring prospects. (He turns to Vladimir.) Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0We can\xe2\x80\x99t. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Why not? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for Godot. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0(despairingly). Ah! (Pause.) You\xe2\x80\x99re sure it was here? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0What? ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0That we were to wait. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0He said by the tree. (They look at the tree.) Do you see any others? ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0What is it? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A willow. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Where are the leaves? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0It must be dead. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0No more weeping. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0Or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not the season. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Looks to me more like a bush. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0A shrub. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0A bush. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0A\xe2\x80\x94. What are you insinuating? That we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the wrong place? ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0He should be here. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure he\xe2\x80\x99d come.

8,b'Dr Fran\xc3\xa7ois Grosjean interviews Eva Hoffman: Lost in\xc2\xa0Translation',"b' I am very honoured to have Dr\xc2\xa0Fran\xc3\xa7ois Grosjean on my blog today, interviewing Eva Hoffman, author of Lost in Translation, originally for Psychology Today. A huge thank you to Dr Grosjean for sharing his interview! About Dr Grosjean: Professor Grosjean\xc2\xa0 received his degrees up to the Doctorat d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\x89tat from the University of Paris, France. He started his academic career at the University of Paris 8 and then left for the United States in 1974 where he taught and did research in psycholinguistics at Northeastern University, Boston.\xc2\xa0While at Northeastern he was also a Research Affiliate at the Speech Communication Laboratory at MIT. In 1987, he was appointed professor at Neuch\xc3\xa2tel University, Switzerland, where he founded the Language and Speech Processing Laboratory. He has lectured occasionally at the Universities of Basel, Zurich and Oxford. In 1998, he cofounded\xc2\xa0Bilingualism: Language and Cognition\xc2\xa0(Cambridge University Press).His domains of interest are the perception, comprehension and production of speech, bilingualism and biculturalism, sign language and the bilingualism of the deaf, the evaluation of speech comprehension in aphasic patients, as well as the modeling of language processing. Here is the interview: Back in 1989, Eva Hoffman published her first book, Lost in Translation, a memoir about immigration, language loss, second language acquisition, and discovering a new land and a different culture. Her autobiography was to have a worldwide success \xe2\x80\x93 the Nobel prize winner Czeslaw Milosz called it \xe2\x80\x9cgraceful and profound\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and it helped launch a new genre, the language memoir. To celebrate this blog\xe2\x80\x99s fifth anniversary, it was only fitting that we should ask Eva Hoffman if she would answer a few questions. She very kindly accepted to do so and we wish to thank her wholeheartedly. More than a quarter of a century has gone by since you published Lost in Translation. How do you consider it now after all these years and the success it has had? Occasionally, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to go back to it and reread parts of it \xe2\x80\x93 and I find that I have a double reaction: One is to wonder who wrote it; and the other is to think, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is pretty good.\xe2\x80\x9d The success of the book was initially entirely amazing to me. When I was writing it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if it would be published, or whether anyone would understand, or care about, the experience I was trying to describe \xe2\x80\x93 the internal journey involved in emigration, and the process of translating yourself into another language and culture. But since then, of course, emigration and other cross-national movements have become one of the central phenomena of our time; and it seems that I identified something about that experience which many others understand \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps in part, because I was writing about it innocently, so to speak; that is, by trying to capture my own perceptions as directly as possible, without thinking about previous literary models, or worrying about the book\xe2\x80\x99s reception. What can I say, I was lucky. You can read the rest of the interview here. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'",https://vickyloras.wordpress.com/2016/03/22/dr-francois-grosjean-interviews-eva-hoffman-lost-in-translation/,,,,,,

I teach students of all ages and levels. When people ask me why I like teaching Young Learners, I tell them that I love it because it is First of all, let us look at who these lovely little people we call Young Learners are. We have Very Young Learners (VYLs), who are 3 \xe2\x80\x93 6 years old and then we have Young Learners (YLs), who are 7 \xe2\x80\x93 12. When I teach them, as do many teachers I know and have seen when visiting their classes, I love to incorporate the element of fun. Children learn in a much more pleasant environment and much more effectively, I believe. To be honest, all students and even adults like the element of fun in their classes! Sometimes however, I have been asked the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you playing, are you just having fun, or are you learning?\xe2\x80\x9d I have been asked this both by parents of students or caregivers, and also by a few teachers \xe2\x80\x93 rarely the latter category, but it has happened! I understand their concerns, and especially in contexts where children need to follow a specific methodology in order later on in life to sit for a language exam. However, I still think that even in those contexts, fun can be part of the lesson \xe2\x80\x93 if not the whole time, even ten minutes at the end can help! Fun ideas are loads to be found, either from colleagues, other teachers we connect to on social media, or social media themselves as resources, like Pinterest for instance. Some fun ideas I use in my classes are: These are only some ideas for Young Learners. The list is endless! Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep in touch! I would love to know what you do with your kids.

Let\xe2\x80\x99s start from the very beginning. k d lang (she writes her\xc2\xa0name in lower case, just like \xc2\xa0e e cummings : ) is a Canadian singer, with a golden voice, and my absolute favourite female performer. Her song Constant Craving is one of my all-time favourites. I just love the instruments used (especially the accordion is haunting and beautiful), the lyrics are amazing and k d\xe2\x80\x99s voice spectacular. The other day, I was listening to the song (again) and paying much closer attention to the video, which I have seen more times than I remember\xe2\x80\xa6and it hit me. I looked at the characters\xe2\x80\xa6they reminded me of something. Are the men in the theater where k d is, playing in Waiting for Godot? I did that play in university, in my very first year in a class called Introduction to Drama. I loved that play so much, that it became the main topic of a paper I wrote then. I checked the story behind the video, and it really is k d in a theater, where this play is being performed! Can I use her song AND the play in class? Sure \xe2\x80\x93 I can\xc2\xa0try! Here is how I am thinking of using it \xe2\x80\x93 let me know if you have any different ideas! I am positive that my students will take me to other places that I had never imagined before, so this is just a rough idea. I am thinking of using it with B2 / C1 / C2 level students, because some of the vocabulary and themes can be a bit challenging for lower levels. So then for my classes, it will be mainly teens and adult students. I will show them the title first. Some initial rough questions: I will let them listen to the song and watch the video then.\xc2\xa0 Then I will give them the lyrics. You can see them and the activities in a document called\xc2\xa0ConstantCraving_LessonPlan\xc2\xa0and feel free to do anything you like with it, change it, create it from the beginning, anything! Here is my favourite live performance of the song, for your pleasure \xe2\x80\x93 happy listening! Waiting for Godot will be the next post \xe2\x80\x93 Part 2!

14,b'Wading the Waters in Education\xc2\xa0#TheHumanTouch',"b' His name is Abdul Malik. He is one of the most inspirational educators I have ever come across.\xc2\xa0One of the stories I have included in the Human Touch presentations I have made in person and online, is that of Abdul. The men and women who have the right ideals . . . are those who have the courage to strive for the happiness which comes only with labor and effort and self-sacrifice, and those whose joy in life springs in part from power of work and sense of duty. Theodore Roosevelt (1858 \xe2\x80\x93 1919) Every morning he sets off to cross the river in his town, in order to get to school. He could use a vehicle or public transport, but it would take him over three hours. By wading in the river, he arrives in fifteen minutes and to his students much faster, as he says. He swims with a tyre-tube around him, and his clothes and food in a plastic bag over his head. When he reaches the river bank right across, he puts on some dry clothes and walks uphill for another ten minutes, arriving at school where his enthusiastic students are waiting for him. Apart from teaching them the school subjects, Abdul also teaches them how to swim. He not only shows interest in the kids\xe2\x80\x99 learning, but also their well-being, by teaching them how to swim and avoid the danger of being in the water. He teaches them great\xc2\xa0human values\xc2\xa0by swimming in dirty waters every morning to get to them on time. This story makes me think about teachers all around the world, and what they do in order to get to class, to teach their kids. Each one of them is wading their own waters. A teacher: When we think of the students and what progress they make and how much they can be helped, as much as how much they teach us during the week, it makes it all worth it.\xc2\xa0 So in one way or another, we are all wading our own waters, metaphorically or literally, just like Abdul. Here is a video about him and his wonderful students:'",https://vickyloras.wordpress.com/2015/09/13/wading-the-waters-in-education-thehumantouch/,1,0,1443266280.0,b'Anna Bartosik',b'',b'Unbelievable'
