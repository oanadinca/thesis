Let\xe2\x80\x99s start from the very beginning. k d lang (she writes her\xc2\xa0name in lower case, just like \xc2\xa0e e cummings : ) is a Canadian singer, with a golden voice, and my absolute favourite female performer. Her song Constant Craving is one of my all-time favourites. I just love the instruments used (especially the accordion is haunting and beautiful), the lyrics are amazing and k d\xe2\x80\x99s voice spectacular. The other day, I was listening to the song (again) and paying much closer attention to the video, which I have seen more times than I remember\xe2\x80\xa6and it hit me. I looked at the characters\xe2\x80\xa6they reminded me of something. Are the men in the theater where k d is, playing in Waiting for Godot? I did that play in university, in my very first year in a class called Introduction to Drama. I loved that play so much, that it became the main topic of a paper I wrote then. I checked the story behind the video, and it really is k d in a theater, where this play is being performed! Can I use her song AND the play in class? Sure \xe2\x80\x93 I can\xc2\xa0try! Here is how I am thinking of using it \xe2\x80\x93 let me know if you have any different ideas! I am positive that my students will take me to other places that I had never imagined before, so this is just a rough idea. I am thinking of using it with B2 / C1 / C2 level students, because some of the vocabulary and themes can be a bit challenging for lower levels. So then for my classes, it will be mainly teens and adult students. I will show them the title first. Some initial rough questions: I will let them listen to the song and watch the video then.\xc2\xa0 Then I will give them the lyrics. You can see them and the activities in a document called\xc2\xa0ConstantCraving_LessonPlan\xc2\xa0and feel free to do anything you like with it, change it, create it from the beginning, anything!

I just love the instruments used (especially the accordion is haunting and beautiful), the lyrics are amazing and k d\xe2\x80\x99s voice spectacular. The other day, I was listening to the song (again) and paying much closer attention to the video, which I have seen more times than I remember\xe2\x80\xa6and it hit me. I looked at the characters\xe2\x80\xa6they reminded me of something. Are the men in the theater where k d is, playing in Waiting for Godot? I did that play in university, in my very first year in a class called Introduction to Drama. I loved that play so much, that it became the main topic of a paper I wrote then. I checked the story behind the video, and it really is k d in a theater, where this play is being performed! Can I use her song AND the play in class? Sure \xe2\x80\x93 I can\xc2\xa0try! Here is how I am thinking of using it \xe2\x80\x93 let me know if you have any different ideas! I am positive that my students will take me to other places that I had never imagined before, so this is just a rough idea. I am thinking of using it with B2 / C1 / C2 level students, because some of the vocabulary and themes can be a bit challenging for lower levels. So then for my classes, it will be mainly teens and adult students. I will show them the title first. Some initial rough questions: I will let them listen to the song and watch the video then.\xc2\xa0 Then I will give them the lyrics. You can see them and the activities in a document called\xc2\xa0ConstantCraving_LessonPlan\xc2\xa0and feel free to do anything you like with it, change it, create it from the beginning, anything! Here is my favourite live performance of the song, for your pleasure \xe2\x80\x93 happy listening! Waiting for Godot will be the next post \xe2\x80\x93 Part 2! Stay tuned.\xc2\xa0'",https://vickyloras.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/the-day-k-d-lang-came-to-our-class-with-godot-pt-1/,11,10,1450817040.0,b'Vicky Loras',b'\xc4\xb0nci G\xc3\xb6n\xc3\xbcl',"b'Dear \xc4\xb0nci,Thank you so much for your wondefrful comment!

12,b'The day k d lang came to our class\xe2\x80\xa6with Godot (Pt\xc2\xa01)',"b' This is a long story\xe2\x80\xa6that can be explained in this post only a little. Along with our students, it can lead us to many places! Let\xe2\x80\x99s start from the very beginning. k d lang (she writes her\xc2\xa0name in lower case, just like \xc2\xa0e e cummings : ) is a Canadian singer, with a golden voice, and my absolute favourite female performer. Her song Constant Craving is one of my all-time favourites. I just love the instruments used (especially the accordion is haunting and beautiful), the lyrics are amazing and k d\xe2\x80\x99s voice spectacular. The other day, I was listening to the song (again) and paying much closer attention to the video, which I have seen more times than I remember\xe2\x80\xa6and it hit me.
