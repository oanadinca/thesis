5,b'I Love Attawapiskat & Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Aboriginal\xc2\xa0Youth',"b' I am from Ontario, Canada. The place where I was born is called Mississauga and it is on the shores of Lake Ontario. \xc2\xa0There is another place in northern Ontario that I have never been to, but hope to visit some day: it is a nation\xc2\xa0in the Kenora District called\xc2\xa0Attawapiskat First Nation\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 it is one of 49 nations comprising the Nishnawbe Aski Nation.\xc2\xa0It came to national news a few months ago, because of the very high rate of suicides that had occurred and unfortunately keep happening, even at very young ages. I started following the news about Attawapiskat any way I could, and saw that the people there have severe lack in housing, medicare, everyday needs. They did not stop, they have not given up. They have a wonderful Grand Chief, Alvin Fiddler, and their\xc2\xa0chief is\xc2\xa0Chief Bruce Shisheesh. Chief Shisheesh met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau two days ago to discuss the actions to be taken for the community.\xc2\xa0 There is a website called I love Attawapiskat & Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Aboriginal Youth, which shows their various activities and the things they do not only to help their own community, but other communities reeling from suicide and hardship across the whole country! Iain G. Speirs and Josee\xc2\xa0Lusignan are in charge of the Twitter account and much more for I Love Attawapiskat\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 they are the founders of this organisation\xc2\xa0and Josee is also the founder of I Love First Peoples; they work tirelessly, night and day! I am in awe of all that they do. On their website you can see different ways to help. With this post, I hope to help raise awareness about Attawapiskat as much as possible. As an educator, aunt, godmother, Canadian and human, I hope to raise awareness for these amazing people, these brilliant children and their lives. Attawapiskat, I have not met you yet, but I know you are amazing and I send all my love and warmest wishes. Will you say I LOVE ATTAWAPISKAT with lots of other people who support the cause? Watch this video with Chief Shisheesh: \xc2\xa0 And here are some of the amazing young people of Attawapiskat, singing and walking for peace!\xc2\xa0 Note: Thank you so much to Josee and Iain for helping me learn so much and adding lots of details to this post.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'",https://vickyloras.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/i-love-attawapiskat-canadas-aboriginal-youth/,,,,,,
