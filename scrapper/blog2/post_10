I understand their concerns, and especially in contexts where children need to follow a specific methodology in order later on in life to sit for a language exam. However, I still think that even in those contexts, fun can be part of the lesson \xe2\x80\x93 if not the whole time, even ten minutes at the end can help! Fun ideas are loads to be found, either from colleagues, other teachers we connect to on social media, or social media themselves as resources, like Pinterest for instance. Some fun ideas I use in my classes are: These are only some ideas for Young Learners. The list is endless! Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep in touch! I would love to know what you do with your kids.
