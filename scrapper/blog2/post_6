6,b'The day k d lang came to our class\xe2\x80\xa6with Godot (Pt\xc2\xa02)',"b' \xc2\xa0 Last December, I published Part 1 of a lesson plan based on k d lang\xe2\x80\x98s song Constant Craving, in\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0combination with the amazing theatrical play by Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot. Many are the times when with students we study literature or work on songs in English. Little did we know, that with working on the lyrics from Constant Craving we would be led to look at parts of a theatrical play \xe2\x80\x93 and some of the students would read the whole thing! In my language classes, due to time restrictions or goals such as examinations or getting to a specific level by a specific time, unfortunately we do not have the luxury of looking at the whole play, which in my opinion is amazing and I cannot do it justice, I feel. However, the parts that we do work on are interesting for the students and lead them to converse and also write in English \xe2\x80\x93 that is one of the things we want them to do. So here we go!  Things we usually do with the students before we start working on the text:\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 When we start working on the text:\xc2\xa0 Here comes one of my favourite excerpts from the play, with two of the main characters, Vladimir and Estragon: ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Charming spot. (He turns, advances to front, halts facing auditorium.) Inspiring prospects. (He turns to Vladimir.) Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0We can\xe2\x80\x99t. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Why not? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for Godot. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0(despairingly). Ah! (Pause.) You\xe2\x80\x99re sure it was here? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0What? ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0That we were to wait. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0He said by the tree. (They look at the tree.) Do you see any others? ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0What is it? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A willow. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Where are the leaves? VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0It must be dead. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0No more weeping. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0Or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not the season. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0Looks to me more like a bush. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0A shrub. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0A bush. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0A\xe2\x80\x94. What are you insinuating? That we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the wrong place? ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0He should be here. VLADIMIR:\xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure he\xe2\x80\x99d come. ESTRAGON:\xc2\xa0And if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come? \xc2\xa0 There are so many things to do with such a play! This is only a tiny part of what we can do with it. I truly do not do it justice at all. Here are some more resources about working with this great play:\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And yet another rendition of the amazing k d lang song that gave me the idea to teach this play! Enjoy : )\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'",https://vickyloras.wordpress.com/2016/05/06/the-day-k-d-lang-came-to-our-classwith-godot-pt-2/,,,,,,
